## Linux Packages

There's no prebuilt Linux packages yet, but you can follow the build instructions to build it yourself :)

Currently we don't generate Windows installers, please also build the project yourself.


## macOS Packages

You might have guessed it, but we don't offer prebuilt macOS packages either yet.
